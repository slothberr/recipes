Ingredients:
 - 3 tablespoons mirin 
 - 3 tablespoons sake 
 - 1/2 cup white miso paste 
 - 1/3 cup sugar 
 - Six 6- to 7-ounce skinless black cod fillets, about 1 1/2 inches thick 
 - Vegetable oil, for grilling 
 - Pickled ginger, for serving

Directions:
 1. In a small saucepan, bring the mirin and sake to a boil. 
    Whisk in the miso until dissolved. 
    Add the sugar and cook over moderate heat, whisking, just until dissolved. 
    Transfer the marinade to a large baking dish and let cool. 
    Add the fish and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

 2. Preheat the oven to 400°. Heat a grill pan and oil it. 
    Scrape the marinade off the fish. Add the fish and cook over high heat 
    until browned, about 2 minutes. Flip the fish onto a heavy rimmed baking sheet 
    and roast for 10 minutes, until flaky. Transfer to plates and serve with pickled ginger.

Make Ahead: 
The marinade can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
